Display a funds raised progress bar and other stats for your Initial Coin Offering (ICO)

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin, offered by ICO Consulting Asia allows you to add a widget to any page or post to display the progress of your ICO including a dynamic progress bar to track the funds raised during the crowd-funding to allow users to visualise their contributions to the project. Supporting any ERC20 token, you just specify your smart contract address and the gateway / proxy to use and the widget will render the key details from your contract including the funding progress, the start date, end date, max cap, goal of the contract. A live countdown will be rendered to show the time remaining before the contract starts or the time left during the ICO
